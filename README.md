# Rivals Workshop Assistant - VSCode Plugin
This is the VSCode extension for [Rivals Workshop Assistant](https://github.com/Rivals-Workshop-Community-Projects/rivals-workshop-assistant)

The assistant is described and documented [here, in the community library.](https://rivalslib.com/assistant/)

## Installation
1. Download and install VSCode (opens new window). 
2. Open the extension manager (Ctrl+Shift+X), search for and install Rivals Workshop Assistant.

That's it. For a better experience, also install `rivals of aether gml support` the same way, for highlighting and completion.
